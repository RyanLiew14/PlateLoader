# Plate Loader

Introducing "Plate Loader", a web application designed for fitness enthusiasts and weightlifting experts. This tool takes the guesswork out of loading your barbell, providing precise recommendations based on user-inputted weight preferences. This is planned to be used in conjuction with another fitness app in creation

# Step 1 - Bare bones text based app 

In this step, I wanted to make sure that I was able to get the math and calculations correct before creating the UI, we got a basic barebones text-version that seems to work!

# Step 2 - Creating bare bones mockups

In this step, I am visualizing the app to look like this:

# Step 3 - Creating the Web application

This is currently in progress, will update when finished!
## 3.1 
We developed a little bit of the frontend! Here we are able to input a weight and it displays the plates that should be loaded on the bar, we have only implemented the kilogram side so far

## 3.2 More adjustments and lbs side added

**At this point the MVP is done, users can now just input a weight and see what needs to be loaded on the bar, I want to add more functionality, but I am going to host this on vercel so users can interact with it, while I work on more changes**
